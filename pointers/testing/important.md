#Important note
Care is needed if one assigns an array to a pointer variable. We remember: Arrays are just pointers to the starting location BUT! the array pointer also holds the information about the length of the array. So when I call sizeof() on the array it will give me the size(length) of the array. If I assign that array to a pointer variable it will only return 4 (on 32-bit systems) and 8 (on 64-bit systems) since that is the size of a pointer. This is called "decay". It happens also when you pass an array into a function so it is ultimately unavoidable but it needs to be remembered otherwise bugs bugs bugs :)
