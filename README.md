# Head First C: A Brain-Friendly Guide

This is my first experience with the head first series, and I have to say I am impressed on how well the knowledge 
in this book is communicated.  
Everything so far has been a breeze to grasp the concept of and memorize the ideas you learn 
throughout this book.  
I can only recommend this book for everyone who wants to learn about C.
