# Summary
A struct is a data type made from a sequence of other data types.  
structs are fixed in length  
struct fields are accessed by name, using the struct.field_name syntax (aka dot notation)  
struct fields are stored in memory in the same order they appear in the code.  
You can nest structs.  
typedef creates an alias for a data type.  
If you use typedef with a struct, then you can skip giving the struct a name.
